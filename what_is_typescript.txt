What is TypeScript??
    - A JavaScript Superset
    - A language building up on JavaScript
    - Adds new Features & Advantages to JavaScript
    - Compiles to JS

    Disadvantages:
        - Browser can't executed by JS environments like the browser.

    
Why TypeScript??

---- EXAMPLE ----
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2
}
console.log(add('2', '3'));
-----------------
- Wouldn't return an error in JS but would return '23' not 5.
